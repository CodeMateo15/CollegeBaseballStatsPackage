# NCAA Baseball Stats Python Package
A Python package for retrieving, parsing, and analyzing NCAA Division I, II, and III college baseball team statistics (2002-2025 seasons).

## JSON Caching for Speed
Store season stats in pre-parsed JSON files, organized by year and division, for reliable, fast offline access.
